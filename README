NAME
    PICA::Data - PICA record processing

FUNCTIONS
  pica_parser( $type [, @options] )
    Create a PICA parsers object. Case of the type is ignored and additional
    parameters are passed to the parser's constructor.

    PICA::Parser::XML
        Type "xml" or "picaxml" for PICA+ in XML

    PICA::Parser::Plus
        Type "plus" or "picaplus" for normalizes PICA+

    PICA::Parser::Plain
        Type "plain" for plain, human-readable PICA+

  pica_writer( $type [, @options] )
    Create a PICA writer object in the same way as "pica_parser" with one of

    PICA::Writer::XML
    PICA::Writer::Plus
    PICA::Writer::Plain

  pica_values( $record, $path )
    Extract a list of subfield values from a PICA record based on a PICA
    path expression.

  pica_value( $record, $path )
    Same as "pica_values" but only returns the first value. Can also be
    called as "value" on a blessed PICA::Data record.

  pica_fields( $record, $path )
    Returns a PICA record limited to fields specified in a PICA path
    expression. Always returns an array reference. Can also be called as
    "fields" on a blessed PICA::Data record.

  pica_holdings( $record )
    Returns a list (as array reference) of local holding records (level 1
    and 2), where the "_id" of each record contains the ILN (subfield
    "101@a").

  pica_items( $record )
    Returns a list (as array reference) of item records (level 1), where the
    "_id" of each record contains the EPN (subfield "203@/**0").

  pica_items( $record )
  pica_path( $path )
    Equivalent to "PICA::Path->new($path)".

OBJECT ORIENTED INTERFACE
    All "pica_..." function that expect a record as first argument can also
    be called as method on a blessed PICA::Data record by stripping the
    "pica_..." prefix:

        bless $record, 'PICA::Data';
        $record->values($path);
        $record->items;
        ...

SEE ALSO
    Use Catmandu::PICA for processing PICA records with the Catmandu
    toolkit, for instance to convert PICA XML to plain PICA+:

       catmandu convert PICA --type xml to PICA --type plain < picadata.xml

    PICA::Record implements an alternative framework for processing PICA+
    records but development of the module is stalled.
